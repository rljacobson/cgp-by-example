# Introduction

This tutorial is a simple, example-first path into CGP.

What to expect:

- Start with CGP from the beginning.
- Build concrete things quickly.
- Learn by wiring real examples.
- Keep explanations short and practical.

In CGP, your main job is usually:

1. define a capability,
2. implement one or more providers for that capability,
3. wire a context to the provider you want.

That is the core loop. Everything else builds on top of it.
