# CGP by Example

`CGP by Example` is a practical tutorial series for learning Context-Generic Programming (CGP) in small, runnable steps.

It exists to provide a simpler on-ramp to CGP:

- example-driven chapters,
- concrete and minimal code,
- short, plain-language explanations focused on "how to do it."

Compared with existing CGP content, this series is intentionally more beginner-oriented and implementation-first. It emphasizes direct usage patterns and current idioms over deep internal mechanics or long comparative detours.
